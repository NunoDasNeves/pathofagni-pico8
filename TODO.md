### Misc
- logo animation? bigger logo?
- parallax the background for top of temple (a little, few pixels)
- use japanese char arrows instead of pico-8 arrows for instructions in first screen
- wizard is maybe too hard?
- Refactor code to reduce lines
    - do all the little fixes like put local x,y,z on one line...
    - hardcode all constants
    - remove unnecessary thang/p/fireball data (hardcode)
    - hardcode sfx/music/etc (do this later i guess)
- fix potential bugs with 'a and b or c' where b is or could be false (it will evaluate to c)
- make doors more visible (color skull/flame?)
- limit enemy sfx to radius around player? limit by open tiles (don't go through walls) - requires flood fill
- save progress (may need a menu for continue/new game, or just use pause menu)
- adjust rain collision boxes? so it's more clear when you're in the rain
    - visual effect/palette swap?

### Levels
- level where bats spawn, gotta kill all the bats to open the door, you can stay and train vs bats as long as you want
    - shortcut to training level?
- reuse wizard spells as enemies? bat spawner enemy, ice nova trap? ice dart trap?
- design/redesign more levels - sketch out last floor
- Probably don't have space for another enemy type unless almost identical to an existing one
- doors can maybe be drawn with palette swap
- text for boss levels

### Sounds!
- fireball explode?
- light lantern?
- enemy die?
- maybe remove bat flap or tone it down even more (use instrument 7?)?
- wizard casting
- wizard finish casting
- wizard shield?
- door open?

### Music
- Keep iterating...
- Come up with a structure that lasts a decent time, using existing ideas
- Chill music for start/regular levels
- Epic music for boss battles

### Enemies
- Underside crawler - spider? 1x1
- Ghost/phantom 1x1
- Moving spikes or something
