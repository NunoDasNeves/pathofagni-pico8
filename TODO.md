### Misc
- make fireball direction a little easier
    - maybe stop movement for some frames after shooting/reduce accel
- make it so you can move a little or retain momentum when charging fireball
- figure out ending
- archer maybe needs to be a little harder?
- wizard is maybe too hard?
- Refactor code to reduce lines
    - do all the little fixes like put local x,y,z on one line...
    - hardcode all constants
    - remove unnecessary thang/p/fireball data (hardcode)
    - hardcode sfx/music/etc (do this later i guess)
- fix potential bugs with 'a and b or c' where b is or could be false (it will evaluate to c)

### Levels
- redesign (tree) tileset
- design/redesign more levels - sketch out last floor
- How to effectively teach player to shoot diagonally?
- How to teach/use fireball slowdown (mainly useful for combat rn, not platforming)?

- cavern levels still have some dungeon stuff left
- doors can maybe be drawn with palette swap
- for DEMOs - maybe have a door to skip floors?
- text for boss levels

### Sounds!
- fireball explode?
- light lantern?
- enemy die?
- maybe remove bat flap or tone it down even more (use instrument 7?)?
- wizard casting
- wizard finish casting
- wizard shield?
- door open?

### Music

- Come up with a structure that lasts a decent time, using existing ideas
- Chill music for start/regular levels
- Epic music for boss battles
