### Platforming
- Tune acceleration, jump dynamics
    - variable jump height? shorter jump, slower/less gravity?
    - instant decel on ground?
    - slow decel in air (momentum from ground speed)
    - air control
#### Maybe
- Wall jump? Slide down? Climb?
- Fireball propels you opposite direction?

### Game flow
- The way it works right now, when you respawn, the enemies in the room you spawn in respawn too
    - Maybe...they shouldn't? So if you die, you don't have to fight immediately on respawning
    - Going to a new room will always make enemies respawn though
- first lantern, second lantern (flag) - so we can have 2 in one room
- fireball direction buffer - use direction from a few frames ago for fireball
    - or sort that out somehow - directing it shouldn't be as hard as it is right now

### Enemies
- Bat 1x1
    - collide with walls, ceiling
    - spread from each other
    - only attack within a certain range?
    - random frame offset on init
- Platform bug 1x1
- Jumping enemy 1x1
- Arcing projectile thrower 1x1
    - adjust throw trajectory
    - run from player?
    - hurt player on touch?
    - maybe different sprite design
- Linear projectile thrower 1x1
- Underside crawler - spider? 1x1
- Ghost/phantom 1x1
- Moving spikes or rsomething

#### Boss ideas
- 2x2 - charging
- 1x2 fast, charging, jumping
- 1x1 fast, jumping, proj throwing
- 3x3 big - stompy, charging type
- multiple 1x1 - chasing flying
