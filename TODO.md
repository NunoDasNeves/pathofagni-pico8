### Misc
- Refactor code to reduce lines...e.g. share physics code, burn code, die code between enemies
- Shooter should spawn a thang (with its own update function) (moving/falling shooter doesn't work properly)
- Moving from room to room - going backwards is weird
    - Don't restore room if it's complete (all bads are gone)

### Sounds!
- fireball explode?
- light lantern?
- enemy die?
- 

### Enemies
- Underside crawler - spider? 1x1
- Ghost/phantom 1x1
- Moving spikes or something
- bat spawning enemy

### Boss ideas
- knight 1x1
    - walk around (toward player)
    - attack when close
    - phase 2 - jump at you periodically
    - immune to fireballs unless he's in attack lag
- archer / rogue 1x1
    - shoots arrows
    - jumps around platforms
    - goes stealth after you hit them, repositions and sneak attacks you
- mage 1x1 or 1x2
    - teleports before attacking or after getting hit
    - casts protection spell which reflects fireballs ?
    - shoots stuff at you ?
    - targeted area, or laser - you see indicator and have to move out of the  way ?
    - spawns bats ?
