### Misc
- logo animation?
- Refactor code to reduce lines
    - do all the little fixes like put local x,y,z on one line...
    - hardcode all constants
    - remove unnecessary thang/p/fireball data (hardcode)
    - hardcode sfx/music/etc (do this later i guess)
- fix potential bugs with 'a and b or c' where b is or could be false (it will evaluate to c)
- save progress (may need a menu for continue/new game, or just use pause menu)
- if you've beaten a boss, and die, respawning shouldn't respawn the boss...
    - only if the boss's animation has finished playing (cos you could die while killing the boss)
- adjust rain collision boxes? so it's more clear when you're in the rain
    - visual effect/palette swap?
- make doors more visible (color skull/flame?)

### Levels
- text for boss levels?
- first level of floor 3 too hard - remove shooter probably, or replace one thrower with shooter
- knight - make it more obvious what to do...
- hint signs? make hint text more obvious?
- think about redesigning charge flame level on floor 2 a little - not obvious you need to charge to get in small gaps
- little bit of tweaking - spikes on charge flame + rain level floor 3
- remove excess ice blocks in blue frog room - distracting

### Sounds!
- fireball explode?
- light lantern?
- enemy die?
- wizard casting
- wizard finish casting
- wizard shield?

### Music
