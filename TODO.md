### Game flow

### Enemies
- Bat 1x1
    - spread from each other?
    - random frame offset on init?
- Jumping enemy 1x1
- Arcing projectile thrower 1x1
    - adjust throw trajectory
    - run from player?
    - hurt player on touch?
    - maybe different sprite design
- Linear projectile thrower 1x1
- Underside crawler - spider? 1x1
- Ghost/phantom 1x1
- Moving spikes or rsomething
- bat spawning enemy

### Boss ideas
- knight 1x1
    - walk around (toward player)
    - attack when close
    - phase 2 - jump at you periodically
    - immune to fireballs unless he's in attack lag
- archer / rogue 1x1
    - shoots arrows
    - jumps around platforms
    - goes stealth after you hit them, repositions and sneak attacks you
- mage 1x1 or 1x2
    - teleports before attacking or after getting hit
    - casts protection spell which reflects fireballs ?
    - shoots stuff at you ?
    - targeted area, or laser - you see indicator and have to move out of the  way ?
    - spawns bats ?


### Playtest notes
#### 0
- Need to teach player to shoot the lantern
- Need to teach player about directional shooting somehow
- It's too hard!
#### 1
- Difficulty spikes too much after initial platforming rooms
- Directional shooting is too hard (can't rely on it)
- Shooting through platforms is not obvious
